A Yes is a No.

If I have learnt one thing about people during my limited time interacting with them, its that a Yes is almost always a No. Coincidentally (or not), a No is almost never a No.

It seems weird, but its not. Commitment is not something everyone takes seriously. Because there is rarely a negative after-effect of saying a Yes and then not following through. Also, some people never say a hard No to anything.

It turns out, everything is negotiable.

A Yes means a Yes if nothing better pans out. A No means try a different strategy.

That is why, you look for the 'Hell, Yes', and you keep pressing until you meet a hard No.

Its exhausting, isn't it?

So don't contribute to it. I try to not.

Words have a lot of power. A simple piece of writing can change your world. One book can transform a person's life. One article can open up new horizons. A sentence can stick with you for days. A word can break someone's heart.

Say Yes when you mean it.
