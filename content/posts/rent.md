There is a concept of "borrowed physique" that bodybuilders talk about. It is usually after a "cycle" when a bodybuilder starts losing his muscle mass that he goes through a difficult phase; some even suffer through depression. Because it is inevitable that your body cannot sustain peak performance for a long time. Escpecially since you cannot affort to run that amount of gear all year.

Veterans will advise you to let it go - to accept that fact that you never own your physique. You merely borrow it for a short period of time. And you have to pay your rent - the damage and stress your body goes through, the stuff you have to eat, the stuff you have to inject, the stuff you have to give up, the stuff you have to go through. No sane man would want to do it, but bodybuilders do not claim to be sane men.

What I have realized is that it is the same with a lot of other things. You can't expect to put effort once to achieve something and then claim it for life. To keep being good at something, you have to keep putting effort. If you don't pay your rent, your skill will be taken away from you. Nature is very forgiving in the fact that it does not take it away immediately like a landlord would evict defaulters. No, it is a slow, gradual decline.
